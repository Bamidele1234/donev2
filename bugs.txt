Thoughts
1. 'Sort by' functionality for tasks

Things I've noticed on other devices
1. Backwards navigation from the Home Screen results in unwanted behaviour

Feedback
1. Uncategorized tasks should have their own category
2. There should be a preset category
3. The edit-name icon should be more visible
