Thoughts
1. 'Sort by' functionality for tasks

Things I've noticed on other devices
1. Backwards navigation from the Home Screen results in faulty navigation
2. The spacing between widgets on the home screen should be reduced
3. 'What's up /name/ gets too big for smaller screens even with the max
length being 8. Try autotext size ðŸ¤§

Feedback
1. Uncategorized tasks should have their own category
2. There should be a preset category
3. The edit-name icon should be more visible
